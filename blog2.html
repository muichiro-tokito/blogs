	<h1>The importance of Science museum in education</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;font-size: 28px;"> Do you know that education can be massively increased with the increase in the number of museums and the reason for it? But first, what are museums, A museum is a building or rather an institution that takes care of artistic cultural, historical, and scientific importance, Many museums put these items in glass containers for people to see. Museums educate people about the past, present, and future, the natural history museum in London, is 1 of the best museums for the knowledge of the past, The Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, the Netherlands is 1 of the best present and the Museum of the Future in Dubai is 1 of best future museums in the world.
<br>
<br>
Now back to the main topic of how can museums increase education, in this, we will be talking about the science museum. The science museum is a good way of increasing the number of scientific inventions as it Inspires students to make their inventions by seeing all of the inventions, it may create a desire to have their inventions in the science museum as well.
At the present moment they are getting enlightened while seeing all these inventions, a science museum is also an easy way to make topics of science easier.
